## 🚀 How to Test Real-time Features

### 1. **Start Development Server**
```bash
cd /home/cello/Documents/TICKTRAX3
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001/
```

### 2. **Run Android App**
```bash
cd /home/cello/Documents/TICKTRAX3
./build-mobile.sh
cd mobile && npx cordova run android
```

### 3. **Test Real-time Features**

#### **Clock In/Out Testing**
1. Open the app on mobile device/emulator
2. Navigate to Time Management
3. Use the Real-time Clock Widget to clock in
4. Observe live duration updates
5. Clock out and see instant feedback

#### **Multi-device Testing**
1. Open app in browser (localhost:3001)
2. Open app on mobile device
3. Perform actions on one device
4. Observe real-time updates on other device

#### **Connection Status Testing**
1. Start with good network connection
2. Observe "Live" status indicator
3. Disconnect network
4. See connection lost notifications
5. Reconnect and observe automatic reconnection

## 📡 Real-time Channels

### **Time Tracking Channel**: `time_tracking:{user_id}`
- **Events**:
  - `clock_in` - User clocks in with timestamp and location
  - `clock_out` - User clocks out with duration
  - `time_entry_updated` - Time entry modified
  - `break_start` / `break_end` - Break management

### **Team Dashboard Channel**: `team_dashboard:{team_id}`
- **Events**:
  - `team_member_online` / `team_member_offline` - Member status
  - `team_stats_updated` - Live team statistics
  - `member_clock_in` / `member_clock_out` - Team time tracking

### **Notifications Channel**: `notifications:{user_id}`
- **Events**:
  - `notification` - General notifications
  - `alert` - Important alerts and warnings
  - `system_message` - System announcements

## 🔧 Real-time Configuration

### **WebSocket URL Configuration**
```javascript
// /src/config/api.js
export const API_CONFIG = {
  BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:4000',
  WS_URL: 'ws://localhost:4000/socket',  // Phoenix WebSocket endpoint
  ENDPOINTS: {
    // ... existing endpoints
  }
}
```

### **Authentication Integration**
- WebSocket connections authenticate using JWT tokens
- Token passed as URL parameter: `ws://localhost:4000/socket?token={jwt_token}`
- Automatic token refresh maintained through existing authService

## 🎯 Real-time Event Flow

### **Clock In Process**
1. User clicks "Clock In" button
2. `RealTimeClockWidget` calls `realTimeService.clockIn()`
3. Message sent to Phoenix channel: `time_tracking:{user_id}`
4. Server processes and broadcasts to all team members
5. Real-time updates received by all connected devices
6. UI instantly updates with new status
7. Toast notification confirms action

### **Live Updates Process**
1. Server sends real-time event to WebSocket
2. `realTimeService` receives and parses message
3. Event emitted to registered listeners
4. Components react to events and update state
5. UI re-renders with new data
6. User sees instant updates without page refresh

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Features

### **Cordova Integration**
- Real-time features work seamlessly in Cordova app
- Device-ready events properly handled
- Network status monitoring integrated
- Background/foreground state management

### **Location Services**
- GPS coordinates captured during clock in/out
- Location data sent with real-time events
- Privacy controls and permissions handled

### **Offline Support**
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Automatic reconnection when online
- Queued actions processed when connection restored

## 🔍 Debugging Real-time Features

### **Console Logging**
- All real-time events logged with emojis for easy identification:
  - 🔌 Connection events
  - ⏰ Time tracking events
  - 👥 Team events
  - 🔔 Notifications
  - 🔥 Errors

### **Connection Status Monitoring**
```javascript
// Check connection status
console.log(realTimeService.getConnectionStatus())

// Listen for connection events
realTimeService.on('connected', () => console.log('Connected!'))
realTimeService.on('disconnected', () => console.log('Disconnected!'))
```

### **Event Debugging**
```javascript
// Listen to all real-time events
realTimeService.on('*', (event, data) => {
  console.log('Real-time event:', event, data)
})
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### **Connection Failures**
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Maximum retry attempts (5) before giving up
- User notification of connection issues
- Graceful fallback to non-real-time mode

### **Authentication Errors**
- Token refresh automatically triggered
- Re-authentication flow if needed
- Secure error messages to user
- Connection re-established after auth success

### **Network Issues**
- Connection status monitoring
- Offline/online detection
- Queued message handling
- Recovery procedures

## 🎊 Success Indicators
